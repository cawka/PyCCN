namecrypto library
==================

This library provides the basic function for name authentication and
encryption. The library is provided with several example files. The examples
do not use the NDN library for sending and receiving interests. Interests are simply stored and read from file.

compute_app_secret_key.c
Run by the configuration maneger (CM). The resulting application key must be
sent to the application

send_command_symm.c
Run on the application. Generates an authenticated interest using the
application secret key

receive_commnand_symm.c
Run on the fixture. Authenticates an interest received from an application.

firstauth_cm.c
Run by the configuration maneger (CM). The resulting interest is sent to the fixture to perform the first initialization

firstauth_fixture.c
Run on the fixture. Authenticates an interest received from the configuration 
maneger (CM) and extracts the deployment information, such as a symmetric 
(encrypted) and a pubblic key and some additional (encrypted) information.
