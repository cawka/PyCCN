What's new in version 0.3
-------------------------

Code refactoring:
- The library has been renamed to py-ndn
- pyccn.CCN is now knows as ndn.Face, being essentialy a handler (face) to the NDN daemon
- New build system using waf-tools

New features:
- LocalPrefixDiscovery
- New methods in ndn.Face: expressInterestSimple, expressInterestForLatest, setInterestFilterSimple
- New methods in ndn.Key: createFromDER, createFromPEM, getDefaultKey
- New method in ndn.KeyLocator: getDefaultKeyLocator
- Key.fromPEM and Key.privateToPEM allows password-based encryption of the private key

Modified functionality:
- Key is saved in slightly different PEM format: generic PEM container, instead of RSA-specific one.
