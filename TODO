- needs to be done
+ finished

known bugs:
+ chat (python part) doesn't seem to work with python3 (need to find out why)
+ receiving.py testcase uses ndnput, it'll fail if ndnput is not in the same
  path

some improvements:
+ poll() is not reliable on Mac, try to replace it with select() or alternative
+ add URI argument to chat
+ combine ContentObject + parsed ContentObject + comps together, same with
  Interest (i.e. all of those parts would be seen in python as one variable). I
  think they're strongly related together.
+ remove all _pyndn_* in front of python commands
+ implement ContentObject.verify()
- providing own timestamp in ContentObject currently will say it's not
  implemented (it'll use current time when not specified)
- KeyLocator when is using KeyName, it needs to include hash of the key as well
- document functions
- key management + name crypto integration (as per another e-mail)

improvements not currently planned to be implemented:
- revise code for generating digest and public keys from private ones (the code
  works, but I feel I'm probably doing unnecessary steps due to not fully
  understanding openssl documentation for example my code to make copy of
  ndn_pkey has 4 steps (make new pkey, wrap it in capsule, convert existing key
  to RSA, put that RSA key in the new pkey - perhaps there's a _dup() call
  which I could use. Or for example the digest code expects key in RSA format,
  then converts it to DER, but in some parts of the code I already have it as
  DER and unnecessarily convert it to RSA to make call)
- add exporting of DER to file (maybe not needed? it can save it to a variable)

Possible problems:
- check key verification (key embedded in content object, or key name)
- test cases to verify ContentObject and Interest generated from ndn_data is
  correct

Documentation:
+ remove license from every file and point to COPYING
+ mention --enable-shared in doc for Mac
- explanatory of locking code in NDN.py in the beginning of the file
