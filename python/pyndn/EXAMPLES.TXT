Need to export PYTHONPATH=/Users/jburke/Documents/workspace/pyndn/Debug

On the Mac, need to make sure you access the version of Python the libraries are compiled against
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python

some examples that should work -

k.generateRSA(1024)
n = Name.Name(["Foo","Foo"])
i = Interest.Interest()

co.name = n
